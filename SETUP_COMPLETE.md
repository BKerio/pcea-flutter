## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **1. Start Your Laravel Backend**
```bash
# Navigate to your Laravel project
cd path/to/your-laravel-backend

# Start the development server
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8080
```

### **2. Verify Backend is Running**
Open your browser and test these endpoints:
- Health Check: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health`
- App Config: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/config`

### **3. Run Your Flutter App**
```bash
# In your Flutter project directory
cd C:\flutterApps\pcea-flutter

# Run the app (Chrome, Android, iOS, or Desktop)
flutter run
```

## 🔄 **User Flow Testing**

### **Test Scenario 1: New User Registration**
1. App starts → Shows splash → Checks authentication → Goes to Welcome screen
2. Click "Member Self Onboarding" 
3. Fill registration form with valid details
4. Click "Register" 
5. Should show success message and navigate to Staff Roles screen
6. User name should appear in the AppBar

### **Test Scenario 2: Existing User Login**
1. From Welcome screen, click "Login"
2. Enter registered email and password
3. Click "Login"
4. Should navigate to Staff Roles screen with user info

### **Test Scenario 3: Authentication Persistence**
1. Login successfully
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app
4. Should automatically go to Staff Roles screen (no login required)

### **Test Scenario 4: Logout**
1. From Staff Roles screen, click logout icon (top-right)
2. Confirm logout in dialog
3. Should return to Welcome screen
4. Authentication state should be cleared

## 🛠️ **Configuration Options**

### **API Configuration** (`lib/config/api_config.dart`)
```dart
class ApiConfig {
  // For local development
  static const String devUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/api';
  
  // For production - UPDATE THIS
  static const String prodUrl = 'https://your-domain.com/api';
  
  // Switch environment here
  static const String environment = 'development'; // or 'production'
}
```

### **Network Permissions**
Already configured for:
- ✅ Android (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`)
- ✅ iOS (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`)
- ✅ Web (no additional config needed)

## 🔍 **API Testing**

### **Manual API Testing**
You can test your Laravel endpoints manually:

```bash
# Health Check
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health

# Register User
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123"
  }'

# Login User
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

### **Flutter API Testing**
Your app includes built-in API testing:
- Navigate to the API test screen from debug menu
- Or add a temporary button to access `ApiTestScreen()`

## 📱 **Production Deployment**

### **Before Production:**
1. **Update API URLs** in `ApiConfig`
2. **Enable HTTPS** (remove `usesCleartextTraffic` for Android)
3. **Update app version** in `pubspec.yaml`
4. **Test on real devices** (Android/iOS)
5. **Set environment to 'production'**

### **Build Commands:**
```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# Android App Bundle (for Google Play)
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS (requires Mac and Xcode)
flutter build ios --release

# Web
flutter build web --release
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

#### **1. API Connection Failed**
- ✅ Check Laravel server is running (`php artisan serve`)
- ✅ Verify URL in `ApiConfig` matches your server
- ✅ Check network permissions are set
- ✅ For web: Ensure CORS is configured in Laravel

#### **2. Authentication Errors**
- ✅ Check Laravel routes are properly configured
- ✅ Verify API endpoints match the integration guide
- ✅ Check database migrations are run
- ✅ Verify token generation is working

#### **3. UI Navigation Issues**
- ✅ Check all route names match in `main.dart`
- ✅ Verify screen names are correct
- ✅ Check import statements
