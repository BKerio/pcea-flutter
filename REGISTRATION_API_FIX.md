# Registration API Endpoint Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

The registration was failing with the error:
```
The route api/member/register could not be found.
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

1. **Wrong Endpoint**: The Flutter app was calling `/api/member/register` but the Laravel backend only has `/api/register`
2. **Wrong Payload**: The app was sending detailed member fields but the backend endpoint expects simple user fields

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Fixed API Endpoint**
Changed from:
```dart
'/member/register'  // ❌ Wrong endpoint
```

To:
```dart
'/register'  // ✅ Correct endpoint
```

### **2. Fixed Request Payload**
Changed from detailed member fields:
```dart
// ❌ Wrong payload - member-specific fields
body: {
  'full_name': fullName,
  'date_of_birth': dateOfBirth.toIso8601String().split('T')[0],
  'national_id': nationalId,
  'email': email,
  'gender': gender,
  'marital_status': maritalStatus,
  'presbytery': presbytery,
  'parish': parish,
  'congregation': congregation,
  // ... many more member fields
}
```

To simple user registration fields:
```dart
// ✅ Correct payload - matches backend expectations
body: {
  'name': fullName,
  'email': email,
  'password': password,
  'password_confirmation': passwordConfirmation,
}
```

## 📋 **Backend Endpoint Documentation**

According to the Laravel backend documentation:

### **POST /api/register**
- **Purpose**: Creates a new user account with member role by default
- **Required Fields**:
  - `name` - User's full name
  - `email` - User's email address
  - `password` - User's password (minimum 6 characters)
  - `password_confirmation` - Password confirmation

- **Response Format**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User created successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "role": "member",
      "role_display": "Member",
      "created_at": "2025-09-19T...",
      "updated_at": "2025-09-19T..."
    },
    "access_token": "1|AbCdEf...",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "dashboard_route": "/member/dashboard"
  }
}
```

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

- `lib/services/api_service.dart` - Fixed endpoint and payload in `registerMember()` method

## 🎯 **User Experience Impact**

### **Before Fix:**
- Registration would fail with API error
- Users couldn't complete registration process
- Error message: "The route api/member/register could not be found."

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Registration should work with basic user information
- ✅ Users get created with member role by default
- ✅ Auto-login after successful registration
- ✅ Redirect to member dashboard

## 📝 **Future Enhancements**

Since the current fix uses basic registration, the detailed member information (presbytery, parish, congregation, etc.) from the registration form is not currently saved. Consider implementing:

1. **Member Profile Update**: After basic registration, call a profile update endpoint to save additional member details
2. **Extended Registration Endpoint**: Create a new backend endpoint specifically for detailed member registration
3. **Progressive Registration**: Save basic info first, then collect additional details in member dashboard

## 🧪 **Testing**

To test the fix:
1. Navigate to registration page
2. Fill out all required fields
3. Click "Register" on the final page
4. Should see success message and redirect to member dashboard
5. No more "route not found" error
